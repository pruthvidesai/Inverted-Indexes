history wherein of antre vast and deserts idle rough quarry rocks and hill whose head touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibal that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose head do grow beneath their shoulder this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affair would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcel she had something heard but not intent i did consent and often did beguile her of her tear when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sigh she swore in faith twa strange twa passing strange  twa pitiful twa wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d me and bade me if i had a friend that love her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she love me for the

which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedy are past the grief are end by seeing the worst which late on hope depend to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserve when fortune take patience her injury a mockery make the robb d that smile steal something from the thief he rob himself that spend a bootless grief brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bear the sentence well that nothing bear but the free comfort which from thence he hear but he bear both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentence to sugar or to gall being strong on both side are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the

advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matter and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona roderigo iago iago what say st thou noble heart roderigo what will i do thinkest thou iago why go to bed and sleep roderigo i will incontinent drown myself iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman roderigo it is silly to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician iago o villainous i have look upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our body are our garden to the which our will are garden so that if we will plant nettle or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herb or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idle or manure with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lie in our will if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and base of our nature would conduct us to most preposterous conclusion but we have reason to cool our rage motions our carnal sting our unbitt lust whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion roderigo it cannot be iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cat and blind puppy i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cable of perdurable tough i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the war defeat thy favour with an usurp beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moor are changeable in their will fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locust shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sate with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drown make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an err barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wit and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drown thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hang in compass thy joy than to be drown and go without her roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hope if i depend on the issue iago thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i re tell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is heart thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many event in the womb of time which will be deliver traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to morrow adieu roderigo where shall we meet i the morning iago at my lodging roderigo i ll be with thee betimes iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo roderigo what say you iago no more of drown do you hear roderigo i am change i ll go sell all my land exit iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport

better shall my purpose work on him cassio s a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let s see after some time to abuse othello s ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspect frame to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that think men honest that but seem to be so and will as

to give satiety a fresh appetite lovely in favour sympathy in years manners and beauty all which the moor is defective in now for want of these require convenience her delicate tender will find itself abuse begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice now sir this grant as it is a most pregnant and unforced position who stand so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio do a knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putt on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection why none why none a slipper and subtle knave a finder of occasion that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantage though true advantage never present itself a

ll prove to desdemona a most dear husband now i do love her too not out of absolute lust though peradventure i stand accountant for as great a sin but partly led to diet my revenge for that i do suspect the lusty moor hath leap d into my seat the thought whereof doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am even d with him wife for wife or failing so yet that i put the moor at least into a jealousy so strong that judgment cannot cure which thing to do if this poor trash of venice whom i trash for his quick hunting stand the putt on i ll have our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moor in the rank garb for i fear cassio with my night cap too make the moor thank me love me and reward me for making him egregious an ass and

to steal away their brains that we should with joy please revel and applause transform ourselves into beast iago why but you are now well enough how came you thus recover cassio it hath pleased the devil drunken to give place to the devil wrath one unperfect show me another to make me frankly despise myself iago come you are too severe a morale as the time the place and the condition of this country stand i could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good cassio i will ask him for my place again he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouth as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast o strange every inordinate cup is unbless and the ingredient is a devil iago come come

than it was before cassio you advise me well iago i protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness cassio i think it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the virtuous desdemona to undertake for me i am desperate of my fortune if they cheque me here iago you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio good night honest iago exit iago and what s he then that say i play the villain when this advice is free i give and honest probe to thinking and indeed the course to win the moor again for tis most easy the incline desdemona to subdue in any honest suit she s frame as fruitful as the free elements and then for her to win the moor were t to renounce his baptism all seal and symbol of redeem sin his soul is so enfetter d to her love that she may make unmake do what she list even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course directly to his good divinity of hell when devil will the blackest sin put on they do suggest at first with heavenly show as i do now for while this honest fool ply desdemona to repair his fortune and she for him plead strong to the moor i ll pour this pestilence into his ear that she repeal him for her body s lust and by how much she strive to do him good she shall undo her credit with the moor so will i turn her virtue into pitch and out of her own goodness make the net that shall enmesh them all re enter roderigo how now roderigo roderigo i do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunt but one that fill up the cry my money is almost spent i have been to night exceedingly well cudgel and i think the issue will be i shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to venice iago how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degree thou know st we work by wit and not by witchcraft and wit depend on dilatory time do t not go well cassio hath beaten thee and thou by that small hurt hast cashier d cassio though other things grow fair against the sun yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe content thyself awhile by the mass tis morning pleasure and action make the hour seem short retire thee go where thou art billet away i say thou shalt know more hereafter nay get thee gone exit roderigo two things are to be done my wife
