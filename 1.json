history wherein of antre vast and deserts idle rough quarry rocks and hill whose head touch heaven it was my hint to speak such was the process and of the cannibal that each other eat the anthropophagi and men whose head do grow beneath their shoulder this to hear would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affair would draw her thence which ever as she could with haste dispatch she ld come again and with a greedy ear devour up my discourse which i observing took once a pliant hour and found good means to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcel she had something heard but not intent i did consent and often did beguile her of her tear when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer d my story being done she gave me for my pains a world of sigh she swore in faith twa strange twa passing strange  twa pitiful twa wondrous pitiful she wish d she had not heard it yet she wish d that heaven had made her such a man she thank d me and bade me if i had a friend that love her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would woo her upon this hint i spake she love me for the

which as a grise or step may help these lovers into your favour when remedy are past the grief are end by seeing the worst which late on hope depend to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserve when fortune take patience her injury a mockery make the robb d that smile steal something from the thief he rob himself that spend a bootless grief brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bear the sentence well that nothing bear but the free comfort which from thence he hear but he bear both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentence to sugar or to gall being strong on both side are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the

advantage come desdemona i have but an hour of love of worldly matter and direction to spend with thee we must obey the time exeunt othello and desdemona roderigo iago iago what say st thou noble heart roderigo what will i do thinkest thou iago why go to bed and sleep roderigo i will incontinent drown myself iago if thou dost i shall never love thee after why thou silly gentleman roderigo it is silly to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician iago o villainous i have look upon the world for four times seven years and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury i never found man that knew how to love himself ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen i would change my humanity with a baboon roderigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it iago virtue a fig tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus our body are our garden to the which our will are garden so that if we will plant nettle or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herb or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idle or manure with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lie in our will if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and base of our nature would conduct us to most preposterous conclusion but we have reason to cool our rage motions our carnal sting our unbitt lust whereof i take this that you call love to be a sect or scion roderigo it cannot be iago it is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will come be a man drown thyself drown cat and blind puppy i have professed me thy friend and i confess me knit to thy deserving with cable of perdurable tough i could never better stead thee than now put money in thy purse follow thou the war defeat thy favour with an usurp beard i say put money in thy purse it cannot be that desdemona should long continue her love to the moor put money in thy purse nor he his to her it was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse these moor are changeable in their will fill thy purse with money the food that to him now is as luscious as locust shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida she must change for youth when she is sate with his body she will find the error of her choice she must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse if thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drown make all the money thou canst if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an err barbarian and a supersubtle venetian not too hard for my wit and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her therefore make money a pox of drown thyself it is clean out of the way seek thou rather to be hang in compass thy joy than to be drown and go without her roderigo wilt thou be fast to my hope if i depend on the issue iago thou art sure of me go make money i have told thee often and i re tell thee again and again i hate the moor my cause is heart thine hath no less reason let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport there are many event in the womb of time which will be deliver traverse go provide thy money we will have more of this to morrow adieu roderigo where shall we meet i the morning iago at my lodging roderigo i ll be with thee betimes iago go to farewell do you hear roderigo roderigo what say you iago no more of drown do you hear roderigo i am change i ll go sell all my land exit iago thus do i ever make my fool my purse for i mine own gain d knowledge should profane if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport

better shall my purpose work on him cassio s a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume up my will in double knavery how how let s see after some time to abuse othello s ear that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspect frame to make women false the moor is of a free and open nature that think men honest that but seem to be so and will as tender be led by the nose as ass are i have t it is engender d hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the world s light exit "
